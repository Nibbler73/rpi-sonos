# [Raspberry-Pi Sonos Interface](https://github.com/Nibbler73/rpi-sonos)

Raspberry-Pi Sonos Interface is a tiny web site to simplify usage of Sonos
Multiroom Speakers.

This project is the product of a simple need: the kids should be able
to choose their own songs without running to mom and dad and tell them
what to do on their smartphones.
